## An App for Booking Accommodation

![image](/public/screenshot.jpg)

Holidaze is a modern, responsive accommodation booking web application developed as part of my final exam project in frontend development. This application serves both a customer-facing side—allowing users to browse and book holiday venues—and an admin-facing side—enabling venue managers to register, manage venues, and handle bookings.

## Project Overview:

Holidaze is an accommodation booking platform created for a newly launched service. The project involves building a brand-new frontend application based on an existing API, as documented in the [Noroff API Documentation](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2). The application is divided into two main sections:

1. **Customer Side:** Users can view a list of venues, search for a specific venue, check availability on a calendar, and make bookings.
2. **Admin Side:** Users with a stud.noroff.no email can register as venue managers, create/update/delete venues, and manage bookings.

This project highlights my ability to design and develop a full-featured frontend application using modern web development practices.

## Project Goals:

- **Demonstrate Development Capabilities:** Showcase comprehensive frontend development skills acquired over the last two years.
- **User Experience & Design:** Deliver an intuitive and responsive UI that enhances user engagement.
- **API Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with an existing API to manage all booking functionalities.
- **Technical Proficiency:** Utilize approved technologies and tools as specified in the project brief.
